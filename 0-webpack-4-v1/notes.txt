must have 
---------
webpack
webpack-cli

above are all u need for default function

needed for tree shake
---------------------
webpack-bundle-analyzer

to run dev server and serve via http://localhost:3000
---------------------
webpack-dev-server

for css u need
--------------
css-loader (collect all css files from project - collects from import statements)
style-loader (takes css code from css-loader and put it in html style tag)
file-loader (loads styles in a css file)

** style-loader throws css inside style tag of html so we use file-loader to load file


you need to add script taga nd include bundle.js but u dont need css file to include in html for dev environment


for scss/sass
-------------
sass-loader
node-sass


to transpile
------------
babel-loader
@babel/core
@babel/preset-env



further approaches and more plugins
===================================
for images
-----------
file-loader will be used for the images to dynamically insert into html



handle html dynamically
-----------------------
html-loader
html-webpack-plugin or html-webpack-plugin@next (will be required and will be called in plugins section of webpack.config.js)
... for this to work system needs source html file that will be in src folder
... output html file will be generated by taking sample from that source html file



clean brfore build
-------------------
clean-webpack-plugin (require it and use it in plugins area of config) / can remove file with selective extensions



combine css and minify plugin
------------------------------
mini-css-extract-plugin
optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin
