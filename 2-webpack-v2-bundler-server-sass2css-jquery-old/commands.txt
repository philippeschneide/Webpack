- transpile from es6 to es5
- Combine js files and jquery and get minified version
- convert scss and get main.css
in dist folder

scss + js/jquery bundler + transpiler (es6 to es5) with old fixed dependencies

==================================
depends on webpack.config.js file
==================================


This script depends on old webpack 2 and webpack dev server and some loaders

run build script and go to http://localhost:8080

or 

run index.html to see output.
dist folder contains minified js bundle and main.css converted from main.scss

> yarn run build
> yarn run build:dev
> yarn run build:prod

or

> npm run build
> npm run build:dev
> npm run build:prod

yarn run build > wont throw bundle.min.js or main.css in dist and it will server bundle.min.js from memory when u browse localhost
yarn run build:prod will create bundle minified file

yarn run build:dev will create bundle.min.js but file will not be minified - in case you need it.

you can remove dist folder and still build will give you output at localhost
