This script depends on old webpack 2 and webpack dev server

run build script and go to http://localhost:8080

or 

run index.html to see output.
dist folder contains js bundle and minified js bundle

> yarn run build
> yarn run build:prod

or

> npm run build
> npm run build:prod

yarn run build > wont throw bundle.js in dist and it will server bundle.js from memory when u browse localhost
yarn run build:prod will create bundle minified file

you can remove dist folder and still build will give you output at localhost
