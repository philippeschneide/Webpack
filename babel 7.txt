babel 7 changes
================
babel-preset-es2015
babel-preset-es2016
babel-preset-es2017
babel-preset-latest
A combination of the above ^

These presets should be substituted with the "env" preset.

babel-preset-env

@babel/core is dependency
babylon is now @babel/parser

Your dependencies will need to be modified like so:
babel-cli -> @babel/cli. For us, we basically started by replacing babel- with @babel/.

module.exports = {
  presets: ["@babel/env"], // "@babel/preset-env"
  plugins: ["@babel/transform-arrow-functions"], // same as "@babel/plugin-transform-arrow-functions"
};

Remove the year from package names
e.g.
@babel/plugin-transform-es2015-classes became @babel/plugin-transform-classes

use strict in commonJS
"use strict";
